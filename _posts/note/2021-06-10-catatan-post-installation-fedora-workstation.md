# Prakata

Catatan ini merupakan kumpulan packages dan beberapa konfigurasi yang saya lakukan setelah melakukan proses instalasi Fedora Workstation.

Saya memutuskan untuk mengkategorikan catatan ini sebagai "note" dan bukan sebagai "blog" karena kemungkinan saya akan terus memperbaharui isinya seiring dengan berjalannya waktu pemakaian apabila saya menemukan paket-paket yang menarik.

Selain itu, memiliki sebuah catatan "perjalanan" akan **menumbuhkan rasa percaya diri untuk terus maju ke depan**. Maksud saya, apabila terjadi kegagalan karena satu dan lain hal, kita tidak segan untuk memulai lagi dari awal. Ataupun, kita dapat dengan mudah memulai percabangan untuk awal baru yang lain.


# Pre Install


## Verify your download with CHECKSUM files.

Setelah mengunduh file ISO, lakukan verifikasi untuk menguji keamanan dan integritas file ISO yang telah didownload.

Langkah awal, import Fedora's GPG key(s).

```
$ curl https://getfedora.org/static/fedora.gpg | gpg --import
```

```
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 12543  100 12543    0     0  10945      0  0:00:01  0:00:01 --:--:-- 10945
gpg: key 1161AE6945719A39: public key "Fedora (34) <fedora-34-primary@fedoraproject.org>" imported
gpg: key 49FD77499570FF31: public key "Fedora (33) <fedora-33-primary@fedoraproject.org>" imported
gpg: key 6C13026D12C944D0: public key "Fedora (32) <fedora-32-primary@fedoraproject.org>" imported
gpg: key 50CB390B3C3359C4: public key "Fedora (31) <fedora-31-primary@fedoraproject.org>" imported
gpg: key 7BB90722DBBDCF7C: public key "Fedora (iot 2019) <fedora-iot-2019@fedoraproject.org>" imported
gpg: key 21EA45AB2F86D6A1: public key "Fedora EPEL (8) <epel@fedoraproject.org>" imported
gpg: key 6A2FAEA2352C64E5: public key "Fedora EPEL (7) <epel@fedoraproject.org>" imported
gpg: key 3B49DF2A0608B895: public key "EPEL (6) <epel@fedoraproject.org>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 8
gpg:               imported: 8
```

Dapat dilihat, kita telah berhasil mengimport 8 public keys.

Kemudian, download file **CHECKSUM** dari yang dapat kita download di halaman ini, [**di sini**](https://getfedora.org/en/security/). Download file CHECKSUM yang sesuai dengan file ISO yang teman-teman gunakan.

Kemudian, verifikasi file CHECKSUM tersebut.

```
$ gpg --verify-files *-CHECKSUM
```

```
$ gpg --verify-files Fedora-Workstation-34-1.2-x86_64-CHECKSUM
```

```
gpg: Signature made Sat 24 Apr 2021 03:37:01 AM WITA
gpg:                using RSA key 8C5BA6990BDB26E19F2A1A801161AE6945719A39
gpg: Good signature from "Fedora (34) <fedora-34-primary@fedoraproject.org>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 8C5B A699 0BDB 26E1 9F2A  1A80 1161 AE69 4571 9A39
```

CHECKSUM harus memiliki keterangan "Good signature"dari salah satu key.

Letakkan file ISO (\*.iso) dengan file checksum (\*-CHECKSUM) pada direktori yang sama.

```
â”œâ”€ ðŸ“„ Fedora-Workstation-34-1.2-x86_64-CHECKSUM
â””â”€ ðŸ“¦ Fedora-Workstation-Live-x86_64-34-1.2.iso
```

Selanjutnya, lakukan pengecekan checksum terhadap file ISO yang telah kita download.

```
$ sha256sum -c *-CHECKSUM
```

```
$ sha256sum -c Fedora-Workstation-34-1.2-x86_64-CHECKSUM
```

```
Fedora-Workstation-Live-x86_64-34-1.2.iso: OK
sha256sum: WARNING: 19 lines are improperly formatted
```

\* Abaikan saja warning 19 lines are improperly formated, hal ini terjadi karena di dalam file *-CHECKSUM tersebut juga terdapat PGP Signature. Coba komentar saja baris-baris selain SHA256SUM valuenya (termasuk blankline), maka warningnya akan ~~berkurang~~ hilang.


# NaN Packages That I Need to Install


## Enable fastest mirror and Delta RPM
Sumber: [https://www.linuxsec.org/2020/03/menggunakan-fastest-mirror-di-fedora.html](https://www.linuxsec.org/2020/03/menggunakan-fastest-mirror-di-fedora.html)

Edit file `/etc/dnf/dnf.conf`, lalu tambahkan baris,

```bash
!filename: /etc/dnf/dnf.conf
[main]
...
...
...
fastestmirror=True
deltarpm=True
```

Kemudian, tambahkan "kode negara" `&country=ID` di belakang meta link repository yang ada di `/etc/yum.repos.d/`.

Repository utamanya adalah `fedora-updates.repo`.

```bash
!filename: /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora-updates.repo
[updates]
...
metalink=https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/metalink?repo=updates-released-f$releasever&arch=$basearch&country=ID

So if there's suddenly a lot of network traffic, you can fire up NetHogs and immediately see which PID is causing this, and if it's some kind of spinning process, kill it.

```
$ sudo dnf in nethogs
```


## Glances

## Tor

Official site: [https://www.torproject.org](https://www.torproject.org)

The Tor network is a group of volunteer-operated servers that allows people to improve their privacy and security on the Internet. Tor's users employ this network by connecting through a series of virtual tunnels rather than making a direct connection, thus allowing both organizations and individuals to share information over public networks without compromising their privacy. Along the same line, Tor is an effective censorship circumvention tool, allowing its users to reach otherwise blocked destinations or content. Tor can also be used as a building block for software developers to create new communication tools with built-in privacy features.

This package contains the Tor software that can act as either a server on the Tor network, or as a client to connect to the Tor network.

```
$ sudo dnf in tor

A flexible DNS proxy, with support for modern encrypted DNS protocols such as DNSCrypt v2 and DNS-over-HTTP/2.

<details markdown="1" style="width:100%;">
<summary style="cursor:pointer;">Features...</summary>
- DNS traffic encryption and authentication. Supports DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)
and DNSCrypt.
- DNSSEC compatible
- DNS query monitoring, with separate log files for regular and suspicious
queries
- Pattern-based local blocking of DNS names and IP addresses
- Time-based filtering, with a flexible weekly schedule
- Transparent redirection of specific domains to specific resolvers
- DNS caching, to reduce latency and improve privacy
- Local IPv6 blocking to reduce latency on IPv4-only networks
- Load balancing: pick a set of resolvers, dnscrypt-proxy will automatically
measure and keep track of their speed, and balance the traffic across the
fastest available ones.
- Cloaking: like a HOSTS file on steroids, that can return preconfigured
addresses for specific names, or resolve and return the IP address of other
names. This can be used for local development as well as to enforce safe
search results on Google, Yahoo and Bing.
- Automatic background updates of resolvers lists
- Can force outgoing connections to use TCP; useful with tunnels such as Tor.

## Neovim

Official site: [https://neovim.io](https://neovim.io)

Neovim is a refactor - and sometimes redactor - in the tradition of Vim, which itself derives from Stevie. It is not a rewrite, but a continuation and extension of Vim. Many rewrites, clones, emulators and imitators exist; some are very clever, but none are Vim. Neovim strives to be a superset of Vim, notwithstanding some intentionally removed misfeatures; excepting those few and carefully-considered excisions, Neovim is Vim. It is built for users who want the good parts of Vim, without compromise, and more.

```
$ sudo dnf in neovim
```

## PostgreSQL

Official site: [http://www.postgresql.org/](http://www.postgresql.org/)

PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management system (DBMS). The base postgresql package contains the client programs that you'll need to access a PostgreSQL DBMS server, as well as HTML documentation for the whole system.  These client programs can be located on the same machine as the PostgreSQL server, or on a remote machine that accesses a PostgreSQL server over a network connection.  The PostgreSQL server can be found in the postgresql-server sub-package.

> INFO

> Bisa baca catatannya di sini, [Mudah Banget! PostgreSQL dengan Podman untuk Development](/blog/postgresql-dengan-podman-untuk-development)

```
$ sudo dnf in postgresql-server
```

```
$ sudo /usr/bin/postgresql-setup --initdb
```

```
$ sudo systemctl start postgresql.service
```

```
$ sudo -iu postgres
```

```
[postgres@fedora-x61 ~]$ createuser --interactive
```

```
Enter name of role to add: bandithijo
Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) y
```

```
[postgres@fedora-x61 ~]$ createdb bandithijo
```

```
[postgres@fedora-x61 ~]$ psql
```

```
postgres=# ALTER DATABASE bandithijo OWNER TO bandithijo;
```

Tambahkan pada file `/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf`.

```bash
!filename: /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
...
...
#host   all             all              127.0.0.1/32            ident
host    all             bandithijo       127.0.0.1/32            trust
```

Or, using another way with Container.

Since, Fedora has built in container utility named as **Podman**. So, I decided to use this tool than using Docker.

I'll use **bitnami/postgresql** container image from **quay.io**.

```
$ podman pull quay.io/bitnami/postgresql:13.3.0
$ podman run --name postgresql --net host -v /var/lib/pgsql/data/userdata:/bitnami/postgresql/data:Z -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes bitnami/postgresql:13.3.0
```

postgresql container imge from bitnami is set **User: 1001**. So, for convenient purposes,

```
$ sudo chown -R 1001:1001 /var/lib/pgsql
```

\* **/var/lib/pgsql** is where Fedora put postgresql data.

Generate systemd unit file.

```
$ podman generate systemd --new --files --name postgresql
$ mv container-postgresql.service /etc/systemd/system
$ systemctl daemon-reload
```

Stop and remove postgresql running container.

```
$ podman stop postgresql
$ podman rm postgresql
```

That's it! Now you're able to start and check the status of running container with systemct start and status.


## SQLite3

A simple terminal UI for git commands, written in Go with the gocui library.

<details markdown="1" style="width:100%;">
<summary style="cursor:pointer;">from Author...</summary>
<p>Rant time: You've heard it before, git is powerful, but what good is that power when everything is so damn hard to do? Interactive rebasing requires you to edi a goddamn TODO file in your editor? Are you kidding me? To stage part of a file you need to use a command line program to step through each hunk and if a hunk can't be split down any further but contains code you don't want to stage, you have to edit an arcane patch file by hand? Are you KIDDING me?! Sometimes you get asked to stash your changes when switching branches only to realise that after you switch and unstash that there weren't even any conflicts and it would have been fine to just checkout the branch directly? YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!</p>
<p>If you're a mere mortal like me and you're tired of hearing how powerful git is when in your daily life it's a powerful pain in your ass, lazygit might be for you.</p>

The recommended way to build is using flatpak, which will take care of all dependencies and avoid any problems that may come from different system configurations.

If you don't have the flathub repo in your remote-list for flatpak you will need to add that first:

```
$ flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

Then install the required flatpak platform and SDK, if you dont have them already:

```
$ flatpak install org.gnome.{Platform,Sdk}//41 org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.rust-stable//21.08 org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.llvm12//21.08
```

To compile and install as a flatpak, run:

```
$ sudo flatpak-builder --install flatpak-build/ build-aux/org.freedesktop.ryuukyu.Helvum.json
```

You can then run the app via:

```
$ flatpak run org.freedesktop.ryuukyu.Helvum
```

## Flatpak via Flathub Remote

Flatpak is a tool for managing applications and the runtimes they use. In the Flatpak model, applications can be built and distributed independently from the host system they are used on, and they are isolated from the host system ('sandboxed') to some degree, at runtime.

Flatpak uses OSTree to distribute and deploy data. The repositories it uses are OSTree repositories and can be manipulated with the ostree utility. Installed runtimes and applications are OSTree checkouts.

## Hide desktop icon on Application List

Sumber: [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/desktop_entries#Hide_desktop_entries](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/desktop_entries#Hide_desktop_entries)

Firstly, copy the desktop entry file in question to `~/.local/share/applications` to avoid your changes being overwritten.

Then, to hide the entry in all environments, open the desktop entry file in a text editor and add the following line: `NoDisplay=true`.

To hide the entry in a specific desktop, add the following line to the desktop entry file: `NotShowIn=desktop-name`.

where desktop-name can be option such as `GNOME`, `Xfce`, `KDE` etc.

A desktop entry can be hidden in more than desktop at once - simply separate the desktop names with a semi-colon.

## Docker

Sumber: [https://developer.fedoraproject.org/tools/docker/docker-installation.html](https://developer.fedoraproject.org/tools/docker/docker-installation.html)

Install the `docker-ce` package using the Docker repository:

To install the dnf-plugins-core package (which provides the commands to manage your DNF repositories) and set up the stable repository.

```
$ sudo dnf in dnf-plugins-core
```

To add the `docker-ce` repository

```
$ sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora/docker-ce.repo
```

To install the docker engine. The Docker daemon relies on a OCI compliant runtime (invoked via the containerd daemon) as its interface to the Linux kernel namespaces, cgroups, and SELinux.

```
$ sudo dnf in docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

Afterwards you need to enable the backward compatability for Cgroups. Docker Engine on Linux relies on control groups (cgroups). A cgroup limits an application to a specific set of resources. Control groups allow Docker Engine to share available hardware resources to containers and optionally enforce limits and constraints.

```
$ sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0"
```

You must reboot after running the command for the changes to take effect

To start the Docker service use:

```
$ sudo systemctl start docker
```

Now you can verify that Docker was correctly installed and is running by running the Docker hello-world image.

```
$ sudo docker run hello-world
```

> PERTANYAAN?
> 
> **Why canâ€™t I use docker command as a non root user, by default?**
> 
> The Docker daemon binds to a Unix socket instead of a TCP port. By default that Unix socket is owned by the user `root` and other users can access it with `sudo`. For this reason, Docker daemon always runs as the `root` user.
> 
> You can either [set up sudo](http://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2015/08/why-we-dont-let-non-root-users-run-docker-in-centos-fedora-or-rhel) to give docker access to non-root users.
> 
> Or you can create a Unix group called `docker` and add users to it. When the Docker daemon starts, it makes the ownership of the Unix socket read/writable by the `docker` group.
> 
> **Warning**: The `docker` group is equivalent to the `root` user; For details on how this impacts security in your system, see [Docker Daemon Attack Surface](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface) for details.
> 
> To create the `docker` group and add your user:
> 
> ```
> $ sudo groupadd docker && sudo gpasswd -a ${USER} docker && sudo systemctl restart docker
> $ newgrp docker
> ```
> 
> You have to log out and log back in (or restart Docker daemon and use `newgrp` command as mentioned here) for these changes to take effect. Then you can verify if your changes were successful by running Docker without `sudo`.

X servers use two schemes to copy text between applications. The first one (old and deprecated) is the cutbuffer. It is a simple buffer in which any application can store text. The other scheme is the selection and works differently. There may be many selections in a single server. An application does not copy data in a selection, it "owns" it. When another application wants to retreive the content of a selection, it asks the owner.
